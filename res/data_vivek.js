And it makes for really great TV.\" <br> This was an effort to analyze the debate show on India's most popular news channel in order to break it down to its most fundamental traits. This frustrating show effectively uses confusion and quarrel to establish false equivalencies and muddy the water, in any given debate. The main idea was to put numbers behind anecdotal claims so as to inspire a deeper study about the nature of 'Debate Shows' on Indian TV. Despite not being statistically significant, deep-diving into one debate efficiently brings forth the ideas to be further explored in an aggregate analysis.<br><br> <code>#chrome-extension #d3.js #javascript #html #css </code>",

There is no agenda, I assure you. I shall not wager my life on the validity of the data here.

The app will remind the user to take the pills at the appropriate time and the weight sensors in the box will verify if the pill was actually consumed or not. Obol will also send a predetermined caretaker about the status of the pills and auto order a new batch if needed. <br>The same concept can be used to make smart benches on counters, kitchens etc. Another application of Obol was to use it as a calorie counter for predetermined items. If you store bread in an Obol box, you will get the total bread calories you consume every day.<br>We won third place at this hackathon.<br>Code for the React Native App : <a href="https://github.com/thebayesianconspiracy/Obol-Android" >https://github.com/thebayesianconspiracy/Obol-Android </a>',

            'description' : 'VoicePay is a voice powered banking application built for the ICICI Appathon 2017. Throughout human civilization, we have strived to make the transfer of value as easy as possible. From the barter system to exchanging goods for gold, to cashless e-payments. The reason is that the easier it is to exchange value, the faster is our economic growth. However payments still have a bunch of problems plaguing them. They are either confusing, intrusive or outright intimidating. So we began with an objective to build a smart, conversational payments assistant, that is omnipresent and the result is VoicePay.<br><br>The backbone of VoicePay consists of a custom skill built using Amazon Alexa, ICICI Retail Banking API and Amazon Voice Service that allows VoicePay to be omnipresent. VoicePay has a query flow which enables the user to get information about payment statuses, loans, balances, or other transaction. On the other hand the transaction flow enables settling a splitwise due, or transferring money to a friend. VoicePay is built with user experience in mind. It can handle multiple styles of speech spoken by the user and also have a full conversation with the user to get missing data that was not provided initially.<br><br>We believe that the future will be devoid of touch interfaces or buttons and all human-machine interaction will take place through voice. VoicePay will spearhead this revolution in the financial world. After the hackathon we will strive further to make VoicePay a one-stop solution for all kinds of monetary transactions. It will be extended to accommodate other third party APIs such as wallets, ticket booking etc with the monetary backend for all these powered by ICICI.<br>Code for the React Native App : <a href = https://github.com/thebayesianconspiracy/gringottsApp> https://github.com/thebayesianconspiracy/gringottsApp</a><br> We won 7.5 lakh rupees for this (2nd place).',

Standardization in weights and packaging of items has saved us an incredible amount of effort and time. But this practice of weighing and calculating price is still followed while buying loose perishable items like fruits and vegetables.<br>In supermarkets, they have dedicated counters manned by store employees who weigh items manually, and enter the item code to generate a barcode which is then stuck on the item. This system is followed for fruits, vegetables, loose grains and sugar. This is where estimato comes in.<br>We can easily replace the human at the counter with a computer that determines what the item is using a camera, and labels it accordingly. It also receives the weight of the item so that it can generate the bill onto an app. We built this for the Big Data Hack by the Rajasthan Government and got selected for the finals which we could not attend, unfortunately.',

We believe that the visually impaired suffer from low confidence and are generally inconvenienced due to how dependant they are on the people around them. We wanted to bridge this need with the help of volunteers who want to help at various different points of time, by making the process extremely convenient and rewarding. <br>The application is gesture controlled, almost entirely. If the user wants to find out the expiry of a medicine, or the price of a chips packet, he/she has to shake the phone, tap the screen to take a picture of the item in question, tap the screen again to record the query. The application guides the individual at all points of time, through audio cues. Once the query is sent, a number of volunteers, based on their geography and language preferences, get a push notification. They have to look at the image and type out the answer which will then be read out of the phone of the person in need. This not only helps the visually impaired, but a large segment of the elderly too, to remain independent and empowered.',
