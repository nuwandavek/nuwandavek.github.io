An expressive oil painting of high frequency sound waves moving through space by Midjourney   The past few months have been witness to some of the most hyped AI demos of recent times. Dall-e, stable diffusion, chatGPT, bing chat etc. have made the promise and fears about AI quite ubiquitous. The underlying technologies are incremental improvements over their previous versions, as with most things science, and not particularly groundbreaking.</description>

I love food. This, on the surface, is a pretty trite statement. But I don&amp;rsquo;t mean I love food the same way one says &amp;ldquo;oh you&amp;rsquo;re going to love this!&amp;rdquo; and show you a mediocre video of a silly dance to which you reply &amp;ldquo;LOL&amp;rdquo;. Everyone involved in this interaction including the dancers in the video know you did not laugh out loud.</description>

      <description>I fastened my seat belt as the sign went off and the air hostess shuffled hurriedly to help people settle down. I was nervously grasping the folder of documents, going through it the third time since I had boarded the flight - passport, i20, university acceptance letter. I put it away, to avoid checking the documents a fourth time. It was August 16th 2019, a day after India&amp;rsquo;s independence day, and I was moving to the USA.</description>

      <description>We were cruising at a comfortable 50 miles per hour on San Diego&amp;rsquo;s I5 as we came up on a bend. I intuitively held on to the seat in front of me, as I was filming from the back seat. George was sitting comfortably, with his hands on his lap, talking to the rest of us about what&amp;rsquo;s in store for Comma.ai. The car followed the lane without breaking a sweat.</description>

      <description>She stared at the screen in disbelief. Till then it was explaining the rules as what can only be described as excitement. It felt like it was really looking forward to play. She half suspected this was a human trait they had explicitly coded, result of an A/B test aimed at moving some complicated metric on some colourful dashboard. But it had just said something that made her blush. Nothing inappropriate, of course, just charming.</description>

      <title>OKRU — Part 2 : Features, Dreams and Promises</title>

      <description>OKRU is a bunch of scratch-your-own-itch, experimental and open-source tools to track goals for ensuring both long and short term accountability. Most things of any value in life are hard and it takes an unbelievable amount of discipline to be even half decent at them. Getting fit in hard. Getting competent is hard. Building useful products is hard. And we can use all the help we can get.
What do the tools actually look like / How does one use them?</description>

      <description>It was cold and damp,
It had been dark for a while
I should have seen about that lamp
But I’d been running in circles
Mile after mile
Where’d you go?
One day you knocked at my door
I wasn’t ready to open
“Go away!” I screamed, and more
