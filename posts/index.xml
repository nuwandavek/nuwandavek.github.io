      <description>You is an auto-completion tool that completes your sentences. It lets you train a generative model that can mimic your personal style over all your text communication. Currently, You trains on WhatsApp chat history, and offers autocomplete suggestions on WhatsApp Web via a Chrome/Firefox extension and a flask server. This can be extended to train and autocomplete on more personal communication apps (Messenger, email, Slack, Twitter, etc.). Everything runs locally and is completely private.</description>

      <description>We were cruising at a comfortable 50 miles per hour on San Diego&amp;rsquo;s I5 as we came up on a bend. I intuitively held on to the seat in front of me, as I was filming from the back seat. George was sitting comfortably, with his hands on his lap, talking to the rest of us about what&amp;rsquo;s in store for Comma.ai. The car followed the lane without breaking a sweat.</description>

      <description>She stared at the screen in disbelief. Till then it was explaining the rules as what can only be described as excitement. It felt like it was really looking forward to play. She half suspected this was a human trait they had explicitly coded, result of an A/B test aimed at moving some complicated metric on some colourful dashboard. But it had just said something that made her blush. Nothing inappropriate, of course, just charming.</description>

      <description>OKRU is a bunch of scratch-your-own-itch, experimental and open-source tools to track goals for ensuring both long and short term accountability. Most things of any value in life are hard and it takes an unbelievable amount of discipline to be even half decent at them. Getting fit in hard. Getting competent is hard. Building useful products is hard. And we can use all the help we can get.
What do the tools actually look like / How does one use them?</description>

      <description>It was cold and damp,
It had been dark for a while
I should have seen about that lamp
But I’d been running in circles
Mile after mile
Where’d you go?
One day you knocked at my door
I wasn’t ready to open
“Go away!” I screamed, and more
But you stood there
Smiling your bright sun-kissed smile
